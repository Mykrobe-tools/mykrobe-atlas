# Mykrobe Atlas + Predictor

Web or [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) for rapid application development.

## Install

* Install package manager

	```
	$ brew install yarn
	```

* Install dependencies

	```
	$ yarn
	```

## Select the target

Selects which version of the app (Atlas, Predictor, TB etc.) you will target for development, test or package. Targets are defined in `/targets.json`. This works by modifying several files and will persist when committed to source control.

```
$ yarn set-target
```

## Web version

- See [Run web version](docs/web.md)

## Desktop version

- See [Run desktop version](docs/desktop.md)

## Tests

#### Install fixtures

1. Download the large 'bams' fixtures from [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/ic5qx6d7vf9j11q/AADOcM0bZt5EfMpwbQ4kRURoa?dl=0)

2. Move this folder into the project at path `/tests/__fixtures__/bams`

#### Run tests

This project has the concept of 'slow' tests. Typically these are tests which involve analysing a sample or compiling the app and may take several minutes to complete.

Potentially slow tests can check if they should execute by checking the for env variable `process.env.INCLUDE_SLOW_TESTS === 'true'`

To run the general test suite:

```
$ yarn test
```

> At present this will generate harmless `PropTypes` and `createClass` warnings. Updating webpack, react-router and then react to current versions will eventually fix this.

To run all tests including slow ones:

```
$ yarn test:slow
```

To run an individual test

```
$ yarn test -t 'AnalyserLocalFile'
```

Note the above two commands will generate different Jest snapshots.

To run just end-to-end tests

```
$ yarn test:e2e
```
