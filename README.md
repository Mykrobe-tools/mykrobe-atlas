# Mykrobe

Web or [Electron](http://electron.atom.io/) application based on [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), [React Router](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/docs/), [React Transform HMR](https://github.com/gaearon/react-transform-hmr) for rapid application development.

## Install

First, clone the repo then install dependencies.

```
$ npm install
```

## Dependencies

* current version of Imagemagick

	```
	$ brew install imagemagick
	```

* current version of Ghostscript

	```
	$ brew install ghostscript
	```

### Set target

Selects which version of the app you will target for development, test or package. Targets are defined in `/targets.json`

```
$ npm run set-target
```

## Run development version

This will launch a local dev server and instance of the app. This has DevTools enabled and supports hot (live) reloading of modified files.

### Browser

This will initially show a 'not found' page while the initial build takes place, after which it will auto-refresh.

```
$ npm run web-dev
```

### Electron

```
$ npm run electron-dev
```

## Web production build

```
$ npm run web-build
```

After build, you will find files in `web/build` folder. To run a simple production server:

```
$ npm run web-build-simple-server
```

## Electron production build

Build for current platform:

```
$ npm run electron-package
```

To build apps for all platforms:

1. Install Wine to build Windows app on mac

	```
	$ brew install wine
	```

2. Package

	```
	$ npm run electron-package-all
	```

3. After build, you will find them in `electron/release` folder. Otherwise, you will only find one for your os.

> **Note:** `test`, `tools`, `release` folder and devDependencies in `package.json` will be ignored by default.
