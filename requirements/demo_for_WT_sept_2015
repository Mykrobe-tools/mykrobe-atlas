Discussed with Simon and Mark 15th July 2015

1. Will arrange future meeting with Phelim also

2. Agreed given short timescale, and given we want to be guaranteed a demo by Sept 8th, to go for the following restricted 
feature set for a demo

A. Set of flat screens, showing the flow of use: authentication, upload, metadata, drug resistance, sample on tree, 
highlighting your previous samples
B. If during August Phelim can build an engine that takes a file and returns the node of a fixed tree which is closest 
to our sample (or maybe the theta/angle at which one should plot a dot), this could be rendered.

All to be discussed with Phelim
