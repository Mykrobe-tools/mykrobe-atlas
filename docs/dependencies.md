# Dependencies

Dependencies should be updated when there is a critical security or business reason for doing so.


## Notes

_These notes should be reviewed when dependencies are updated to ensure they remain relevant:_

- Resumable JS is referenced directly from Github (`23/resumable.js`) rather than npm due to the latest npm release (`v1.0.2`) being from March 2015, and lacking many of the latest improvements to the codebase.
