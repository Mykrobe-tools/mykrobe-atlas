# Mykrobe Atlas Targets

_This is a legacy feature and should be removed - see `1021-remove-legacy-set-target-species-etc`_

Selects which version of the app (TB, S.Aureus etc.) you will target for development, test or package. Targets are defined in `/targets.json`. This modifies several files and will persist when committed to source control.

```
$ yarn set-target
```
