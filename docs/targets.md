## Targets

Selects which version of the app (Atlas, Predictor, TB etc.) you will target for development, test or package. Targets are defined in `/targets.json`. This works by modifying several files and will persist when committed to source control.

Select an *Atlas* target for [Web](web.md), or *Predictor* target for [Desktop](desktop.md)

```
$ yarn set-target
```
