# Mykrobe Atlas Targets

Selects which version of the app (Web, Desktop, TB, S.Aureus etc.) you will target for development, test or package. Targets are defined in `/targets.json`. This works by modifying several files and will persist when committed to source control.

Select a *Web* target for [Web](web.md), or *Desktop* target for [Desktop](desktop.md)

```
$ yarn set-target
```
